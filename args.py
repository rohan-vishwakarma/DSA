# the *args is a non keyword argument which is used to pass variable number of arguments to a function

# The **Kwargs are the keyword argument One can think of the kwargs as being a dictionary that maps each keyword to the 
# value that we pass alongside it. 
# That is why when we iterate over the kwargs there doesnâ€™t seem to be any order in which they were printed out.
